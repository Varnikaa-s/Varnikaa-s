### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<h1 align="center">Hi ğŸ‘‹, I'm Varnika Singh</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a 10+2 passout from the batch of 2022-23 from DPSG</h3>

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m in my First year in BTech CSE course in UPES, Dehradun.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m presently learning Git hub and C language
- ğŸ’¬My hobbies are to read books, to play basketball, and i do like to explore off track places.

- âš¡ Fun fact about me :  I am an explorer with no experience of CS or git hub but have a keen interest to learn about everything and want to create many creative apps as a developer.
